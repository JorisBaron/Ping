A simple Minecraft mod that pings you when you are mentioned in chat, like an IRC client. This mod is completely client-side.

It also has the ability to style chat messages you are mentioned in, allowing underscoring, bolding, italicizing, strikethrough, and all of Minecraft's supported color styles. It adds several new sound types to choose from. Lastly, you can specify custom nick names (separated by semicolon). All of this configuration is done in the Ping! config file.
